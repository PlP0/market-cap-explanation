if a company fails its because they aren't providing/creating value
if someone creates value someone is going to want it etc etc. (for another video - incomplete quote i came up with to work on - also people
would make more money if they made things to help others rather than to make money - thats why businesses fails)

the biggest mistake people make is doubting themselves clip/quote i forgot what it said

Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap!  Thats how valuable Bitcoin is at the time of this recording!  Its actually bigger

than walmart and amazon at the time of this recording - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally owning piece of the company? - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - giving Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - because you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset/mentality are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head -  they don't even understand how valuable a market is to begin with! 

So they literally can't set realistic expectations! If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - because theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

In order for $DOGE to trade for $1000 per token - its market cap would need to reach about $140 Trillion Dollars - theres simply enough money in the

world to flow into $DOGE coin to raise its market cap to such extremes that its price blasts beyond $1,000 per token - 

Not even the U.S. National Debt is that big! - or is it?  Just kidding - but look even with $BITCOINS all time high market cap of $1.2 Trillion - 

that would only put $DOGE at $8.00 per token - so now lets be realistic why would anyone buy $DOGE for $1,000 when they can just scoop it up for a couple of 

cents from exchanges ? the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable as someone will 

immediately cash out - and change their lifes forever by dumping on the market! The only other way for $DOGE to hit $1,000 per token would be

via Hyper Inflation - but we're not gonna go there today - So what you should take out of all this is that the supply of stonks and tokens plays a 

key role/factor in determining an assets value - scarcity mingled with supply and demand will determines its value - for they're only worth as much 

as people are willing to pay for them - and their value times the supply circulating in the economy tells you how valuable a market is!

Hence the word Market Cap! Market Cap is most useful in figuring out how big a market, company, or crypto project is!  

You see theres a spectrum of market cap sizes - 

Starting with the largest we have 

HUMONGOUS HUGE MEGA LARGE CAPS = ANYTHING BEYOND $1 Trillion Market Cap can be considered HUUUUUUGE - HUMONGOUS

which is anything beyond/bigger than a trillion dollars - 

not many companies achieve this - but if you were to sum up the value of something like all the real-estate market - or all the banks

in the world - thats when you start seeing these multi $trillion dollar evaluations - 

Apple, Amazon, and Bitcoin are ALL assets that have been beyond the $Trillion Dollar evaluation before - 

Bezzos was only worth whatever he owned in stonks of amazon 

usually older and more mature companies achieve this - like Apple and Amazon - 

The RealEstate Market globally is worth trillions
Banking is also a multi trillion dollar industry 


Theres HUMONGOUS MEGA LARGE CAPS = 

HUMONGOUS HUGE LARGE +200 Billion
Large Cap 10-200 Billion
Mid Cap 2-19 Billion
Small Cap 300 Million - 2 Billion
MicroCap 50 Million - 300 Million
SUPER ULTRA DIAMOND MICROCAP SUPER GEM - > anything below 50 million

returns are exponential
lower  = riskier
higher = stabler
higher risk = higher return  

There are 4 times


why buy stonks? dividends
growth = returns


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example - two tokens can have same price with different market caps 

and its potential for growth! 

it tells you how much 

There are diferent sizez
