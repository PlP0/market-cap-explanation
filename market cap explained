Hello World -

If you're Investing in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

AND If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that will give you the market cap!  For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading

at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you just multiply the X tokens times $ each and that gives you the total market cap evaluation of

$X - So market cap tells you how valuable a market/company/or project is - Look in order to own a company - you have to own ALL the shares of a company

When you invest - you're really purchasing A SHARE of the company - you're buying OWNERSHIP of it - so if you own stonks - as the share hodler

you're part owner of the company


You know how Elon Musk recently purchased twitter for $44 Billion Dollars?



Well in order to own a company - you must own all the shares of a company - and Elon offered to purchase ALL THE TWITTER STONKS for $54.20

LIKE THE LEGEND HE IS - so thats how th

The way they got to that evaluation that Twitter was worth $X is by multiplying all the twitter stonks 



- an evaluation of how valuable the market/company/ or project is - You know how Elon Musk recently bought twitter for $X ? 

You own the stonks you own the company

This understandment serves as your eyes - without it you are blind - 

For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the mindset that "If BitCoin was once under a cent - and is now

worth thousands - I don't see why Doge Coin can't do the same" - But you see these people are blind - they simply can't see the equation

in their head - the numbers - so they literally can't calculate realistic expectations!  They don't know how valuable a stonk or token

can become because they don't understand this simple equation to calculate the market cap!  Because if they did - they would 

see that in order for Doge Coin to be worth $X - it would need to have a market cap of $X - and look theres only so much money in the world - 

so the markets can only get so big - unfortunately there isn't enough money in the world to flow into DOGE COIN to make it worth $X - 

Prices are based on supply and demand - however much people are willing to pay for it - and like cmon no one will pay $X for a Doge Coin

when you can pick them up for $.08

Market Caps are useful to find out how big a company is -
