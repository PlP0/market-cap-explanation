Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap!  Thats how valuable Bitcoin is at the time of this recording!  Its actually bigger

than walmart and amazon at the time of this recording - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally owning piece of the company? - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - giving Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - because you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset/mentality are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head - they don't even understand how valuable a market is to begin with!

So they literally can't calculate and set realistic expectations!  If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

there isn't enough money in the world to flow into $DOGE to raise its market cap to such extremes that its value goes to $1000

the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable as someone will cash out immediately

specially when you can purchase them for a couple of cents elsewhere - Doge Coin with Bit Coins Market Cap would be worth $X - so as you can see here

the number of tokens play a key factor in giving a token its value - scarcity - supply and demand - and then the price of each will lead you to the

market cap 

Prices are based on supply and demand - however much people are willing to pay for it - and like cmon be realistic - no one will pay thousands

of dollars for Doge Coins when you can pick them up for $.08 - 

Market Caps are useful to find out how big a company is - 


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example
