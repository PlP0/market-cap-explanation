if a company fails its because they aren't providing/creating value
if someone creates value someone is going to want it etc etc. (for another video - incomplete quote i came up with to work on - also people
would make more money if they made things to help others rather than to make money - thats why businesses fails)

if you zoom out and look at the evolution of money you'll see that coins turned to paper ious and now those paper ious have turned digital

and now they're making crypto currencies as ious and they have value because people believe in it

the biggest mistake people make is doubting themselves clip/quote i forgot what it said 
doge


Hello World -

If you're Investing in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the term "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - & you don't know what you're doing

Don't worry though you're not alone, 90% of people that buy Stonks & Cryptos don't think of them the right way either, when they buy - they

hope it goes up the following week & if it goes down they freak out. So the psychology behind this tells us that 90% of pepople have short sighted

vision - they aren't looking far enough into the future to see how valuable their investment could potentially become.  Technology has us so accostumed

to instant gratification - that most people don't have the capacity to wait to see their investment portoflios grow - they become impatient &

sell at a loss - veteran investors call these people panic sellers - so separate yourself from the crowd - you don't want to be like the 90%.  

Understand that investing is a tool to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient - When I buy, I pray prices fall - because I don't care about what

the price will be next week or next month - I'm focused on what the price will become in 10-20 years! So when prices fall I BUY EVEN MORE! 

ITS CALLED BEING A MOTHER TRUCKING DEGEN! UNFAZED TO TAKE RISK - BECAUSE THATS WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT! & If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - 

YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS AND BROADEN YOUR VOCABULARY! So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to 

determine how much money you can actually make in any investment - Hence - Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for 

Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto that literally just tells you how valuable a company is - The Market cap of a company or 

crypto currency is determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  

An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is! For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of 19 Million tokens - currently trading at 

$25,000 each - to calculate the market cap you would need to multiply the 19 Million

tokens times $25,000 each and that would give you a total of $xxx,xxx,xxx,xxxx as the market cap!  Walmart's market cap is currently sitting at $xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx - 

So Bitcoin is actually more LARGER & MORE valuable than Walmart!  And its only been around for 14 years, as compared to Walmarts 60!  Thats why you'll

often see people labeling Crypto as the FASTEST appreciating asset class in history! - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally 

owning piece of the company? - thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL 

the stonks - Remember when Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to 

about $44 billion - so basically ALL the Twitter share hodlers sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - granting Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand what market cap is and how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without the undestandment 

you're just blind - you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors, or moon bois who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that 

"If BitCoin was once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this 

mindset/mentality are blind - they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head - they don't even understand how valuable the company or project 

is to begin with! So they literally can't set realistic expectations! If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - because theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

In order for $DOGE to grow to $1000 per token - its market cap would need to reach $140 Trillion Dollars - & theres simply not enough money in the

world to flow into $DOGE coin to raise its market cap to such extremes that its price slingshots/moons beyond $1,000 per token - 

Not even the U.S. National Debt is that big! - or is it?  Just kidding - but look even with $BITCOINS all time high market cap of $1.2 Trillion - 

that would only put $DOGE at $8.00 per token - so now lets be realistic why would anyone buy $DOGE for $1,000 when they can just scoop it up for a couple of 

cents from exchanges ? the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable for someone will 

cash out immediately - and change their lifes forever by dumping on the market! The only other way for $DOGE to hit $1,000 per token would be

via Hyper Inflation - but we're not gonna go there today - Its also important to know that the supply of stonks or tokens plays a 

key role/factor in determining an assets value - scarcity mingled with supply and demand will determines an assets value - for they're only worth as much 

as people are willing to pay for them - sellers on the other hand decide for how much they're willing to let go of their assets - 

The assets price times the circulating supply in the economy tells you how valuable the market is!

Hence the word Market Cap! Market Cap is most useful in determining the size of a market, company, or crypto project!  

Allowing you to compare their sizes and set more realistic expectations on to how big your investment can grow! 

You see theres a spectrum of market cap sizes - 

Starting with the largest we have what I call HUMONGOUS HUGE MEGA LARGE CAPS = ANYTHING BEYOND $1 Trillion 

Market Cap can be considered HUUUUUUGE - HUMONGOUS - For example Black Rock is in the business of selling stonks - and they're currently managing

over $10 Trillion Dollars worth of Assets! $Apple and $Amazon are also in this HUMONGOUS cap category - because their market caps are over $1 Trillion - meaning

all their stonks combined are worth $Trillions of dollars! - By the way the Net Worth Evaluation for Billionaires, like Bezos - actually comes 

not just from money sitting in the bank but from owning assets and stonks! and why would you want to own stonks?  Well according to TheRealBradLea - 

"the CEO of coca cola made 50 billion bucks last year - as earned income - governments can take half of it - warren buffet invests in coca cola - 

and he was payed 508 Million - as passive income - you know how a lot of people in the internet want to be the boss? well the boss doesn't make any money - 

the investor does - don't be the boss - don't be the ceo - be the investor - because investors receive dividends quarterly for owning companies! 

dividends are a distribution of a company's profits to its shareholders determined by the company's board of directors. 

So when a corporation earns a profit or surplus, they pay a portion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken 

to be re-invested in the business. Bitcoin was once a $Trillion Dollar Asset too, inside the HUMONGOUS category but has since

crashed and fallen into the MEGA LARGE CAP category - which is anything between $200 Billion to $1 Trillion

Walmart is in this Category - currently sitting at $382.16 Billion Dollars

The reason they're called MEGA LARGE CAPS is because anything in this category or bigger - are simply already too big already if you're trying to make 

generational wealth to retire - so if you're trying to make life changing gains with these types of companies and you're poor - i'm sorry but you've already 

missed the train - I often see new investors with 0 knowledge about market cap throw money at mom and pops classic stonks like Walmart in hopes that it will

make them vasts amounts of money to retire - and then get mad because their $10 dollar investment doesn't turn into $1,000 over night and instead see

their investment fall - then they proceed to talk shit about investing to discourage you and others from participating - If only they understood the 

concept of market cap - they would be able to see that in order for their $10 investment in a Walmart to turn into $1,000 - $Walmart Stonks would need to 

grow 100X in price! Putting its market cap to $382 Trillion! Which is more money than there even exists! And like I said earlier - theres only so much in the 

world! So $382 Trillion Walmart isn't going to be happening any time soon... and thats just a mathematical fact!

A more realistic expectation if you're investing in walmart would be for the market cap to hit something like $764 Billion one day - which would

basically just double its market cap - making your initial $10 into $20 - and although that doesn't sound like much - it can go a long way

Because lets say all you have is $1000 to get started on your investing journey, if you double your money 10 times - you would turn your $1,000 into $1,000,000

So by doubling your money ten times from $1000 you would end up at $1,000,000 -  Look i'm not into stonks - i'm just setting some examples - 

and I know that as more dollars are created via inflation - naturally the price of assets will rise -

because the supply of cash increases while the supply of assets remain the same - so owning stonks and crypto can be a hedge against inflation - 

Anyways next are the Large Caps - typically ranging anywhere from $20-200 Billion. These companies and crypto projects are big too - but they have the potential

to yield more exciting returns than a MEGA Large Caps - because they're smaller!  And if the company or crypto project hasn't finished maturing or 

reached its peak value - there could still be room for growth!  For example right now $XRP is currently valued at $20 Billion - Bitcoin on the other hand

is currently at $449 Billion.  If Bitcoin goes back to its all time high of $1.2 Trillion - it would more less triple your wealth - however

if $XRP went to $1.2 Trillion you would __ X your investment - which is far more exciting!  These 2 coins are competing for a larger share

of the pie of wealth that exists in the world!  And both have utility!  Personally I find $XRP to be more useful than $BTC - so if I bet on $XRP

catching up to $BTC - and one day it does - and surpasses bitcoin - I will multiply my money BY A LOT MORE THAN Bitcoins promise of a 3X if it goes

back to all time highs - so 1 trillion folwing in example

for example 

more exciting because not many get to trillion but 
but they can still

probably get you like a 5-10X return if they're still maturing - which is a lot more exciting than a 2X return on your investment - because you can get to 

$1,000,000 faster - for example if you can score 3 10 exes in a row on an initial $1,000 investment - you would get to $1,000,000 - and that 

are companies that are already big - but you can probably still 

score much bigger than a simple 2X

Then are the Mid Caps at 2-19 Billion

Small Caps at 300 Million - 2 Billion

MicroCaps between 50 Million - 300 Million

and SUPER ULTRA DIAMOND MICROCAP SUPER GEM - > anything below 50 million

Also I do want to say - that I made this chart up in case it wasn't obvious enough - however this is the rubric I use in my mind to determine

the size of companies before investing - and many experienced investors have a similar rubric in their mind to classify sizes of market caps

in their minds - 


Alkimi + staking

returns are exponential
lower  = riskier
higher = stabler
higher risk = higher return  

There are 4 times


why buy stonks? dividends
growth = returns


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example - two tokens can have same price with different market caps 

and its potential for growth! 

it tells you how much 

There are diferent sizez 

small caps more room to grow
explain how over complicate words in finance
how to use
dividends - stake
why important
how use
dividend stoake

small = more volitile
diviersify portfolio 

rich middle small
