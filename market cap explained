if a company fails its because they aren't providing/creating value
if someone creates value someone is going to want it etc etc. (for another video - incomplete quote i came up with to work on - also people
would make more money if they made things to help others rather than to make money - thats why businesses fails)

the biggest mistake people make is doubting themselves clip/quote i forgot what it said

Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap!  Thats how valuable Bitcoin is at the time of this recording!  Its actually bigger

than walmart and amazon at the time of this recording - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally owning piece of the company? - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - giving Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - because you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset/mentality are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head -  they don't even understand how valuable a market is to begin with! 

So they literally can't set realistic expectations! If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - because theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

In order for $DOGE to trade for $1000 per token - its market cap would need to reach about $140 Trillion Dollars - theres simply enough money in the

world to flow into $DOGE coin to raise its market cap to such extremes that its price blasts beyond $1,000 per token - 

Not even the U.S. National Debt is that big! - or is it?  Just kidding - but look even with $BITCOINS all time high market cap of $1.2 Trillion - 

that would only put $DOGE at $8.00 per token - so now lets be realistic why would anyone buy $DOGE for $1,000 when they can just scoop it up for a couple of 

cents from exchanges ? the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable as someone will 

immediately cash out - and change their lifes forever by dumping on the market! The only other way for $DOGE to hit $1,000 per token would be

via Hyper Inflation - but we're not gonna go there today - So what you should take out of all this is that the supply of stonks and tokens plays a 

key role/factor in determining an assets value - scarcity mingled with supply and demand will determines its value - for they're only worth as much 

as people are willing to pay for them - and their value times the supply circulating in the economy tells you how valuable a market is!

Hence the word Market Cap! Market Cap is most useful in figuring out how big a market, company, or crypto project is!  

You see theres a spectrum of market cap sizes - 

Starting with the largest we have 

HUMONGOUS HUGE MEGA LARGE CAPS = ANYTHING BEYOND $1 Trillion Market Cap can be considered HUUUUUUGE - HUMONGOUS

not many companies achieve this - but if you were to sum up the value of something like all the global real-estate market - or all the banks

in the world - thats when you start seeing these multi $trillion dollar evaluations - Black Rock, for example - is in the business

of selling stonks - thus they have a share in every company in the world - currently managing over $10 Trillion Dollars worth of Assets! 

$Apple and $Amazon are in this HUMONGOUS cap category - because their market caps are over $1 Trillion - meaning

all their stonks combined are worth $Trillions at the moment - The Net Worth Evaluation for Billionaires, like Bezos - part of it actually comes 

from owning stonks in companies! and why would you want to own stonks?  Well according to TheReaBradLea - "the CEO of coca cola made 50 billion bucks 

last year - thats earned income - governments can take half of it - warren buffet invests in coca cola - he was payed 508 Million - 

thats passive income - you know how a lot of people in the internet want to be the boss? the boss doesn't make any money - the investor does - 

don't be the boss - don't be the ceo - be the investor - because investors typically receive dividends quarterly for owning part of the company! 

dividends are a distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors . In other words -

its the distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the 

profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business. Bitcoin was once a $Trillion Dollar Asset but since

the crash its now fallen into the MEGA LARGE CAP category - which is anything between $200 Billion to $1 Trillion

Walmart is also in this Category - currently sitting at $382.16 Billion Dollars

The reason they're called MEGA LARGE CAPS is because anything in this category or bigger is simply already too big already if you're trying to make 

generational wealth to retire - so you've if you're trying to make life changing gains with these types of companies - you've already missed the train 

I often see new investors with 0 knowledge about market cap throw money at mom and pops classic stonks like Walmart in hopes that it will

make them insane amounts of wealth to retire - then they get mad because their $10 dollar investment doesn't turn into $1,000 over night as they see

their investment fall - then they proceed to talk shit about investing to discourage you and others from doing so too - If only they understood the 

concept of market cap - they would be able to see that in order for their $10 investment in a Walmart to turn into $1,000 - $Walmart Stonks would need to 

100X in price! Putting the market cap at $382 Trillion! Which is more money than there probably even exists!  These are just the Mathematical facts!

So like I was saying earlier - theres only so much in the world! So $382 Trillion Walmart is not going to be happening any time soon...  

A more realistic expectation if you're investing in walmart would be for the market cap to hit something like $764 Billion one day - which would

basically just double its market cap - making your initial $10 into $20 - and although that doesn't sound like much - it can go a long way

Because if you think about it - if you have $1000, and you double it 10 times in a row - you would turn your $1,000 into $1,000,000

so by doubling your money ten times from $1000 you would get to $1,000,000 - Don't get me wrong though - this isn't any financial advice -

I have no reason to believe walmart is going to double in price any time soon - in fact I don't even own $Walmart Stonks - or any stonks

for that matter - i'm not into stonks - i'm just setting some examples - and as more dollars are created via inflation - naturally

the price of assets will rise - so owning stonks and crypto can be used to hedge against inflation - because as the money supply increases - the 

amount of assets remain the same 

So next are the Large Caps - typically ranging anywhere from $20-200 Billion. These companies or crypto projects are big too - but they have the potential

to yield more exciting returns than a MEGA Large Caps - because they're smaller!  And if the company or crypto project hasn't finished maturing or 

reached its peak value - there could still be room for growth!  For example right now $XRP is currently valued at $20 Billion - Bitcoin on the other hand

is currently at $449 Billion.  If Bitcoin goes back to its all time high of $1.2 Trillion - it would more less triple your investment - however

if $XRP went to $1.2 Trillion you would __ X your investment - which again thats more exciting!  Because these 2 coins are both fighting for a larger share

of the pie of wealth that exists in the world!  And both have utility!  And personally I find $XRP to be more useful than $BTC - so if I bet on $XRP

catching up to $BTC - and one day it does - and perhaps even surpass it - I will multiply my money BY A LOT MORE THAN Bitcoins promise of a 3X if it goes

back to all time highs - so 1 trillion folwing in example

for example 

more exciting because not many get to trillion but 
but they can still

probably get you like a 5-10X return if they're still maturing - which is a lot more exciting than a 2X return on your investment - because you can get to 

$1,000,000 faster - for example if you can score 3 10 exes in a row on an initial $1,000 investment - you would get to $1,000,000 - and that 

are companies that are already big - but you can probably still 

score much bigger than a simple 2X

Then are the Mid Caps at 2-19 Billion

Small Caps at 300 Million - 2 Billion

MicroCaps between 50 Million - 300 Million

and SUPER ULTRA DIAMOND MICROCAP SUPER GEM - > anything below 50 million

Also I do want to say - that I made this chart up in case it wasn't obvious enough - however this is the rubric I use in my mind to determine

the size of companies before investing - and many experienced investors have a similar rubric in their mind to classify sizes of market caps

in their minds - 


Alkimi + staking

returns are exponential
lower  = riskier
higher = stabler
higher risk = higher return  

There are 4 times


why buy stonks? dividends
growth = returns


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example - two tokens can have same price with different market caps 

and its potential for growth! 

it tells you how much 

There are diferent sizez 

small caps more room to grow
explain how over complicate words in finance
how to use
dividends - stake
why important
how use
dividend stoake

small = more volitile
diviersify portfolio 

rich middle small
