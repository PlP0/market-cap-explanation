Hello World -

If you're Investing in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

AND If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that will give you the market cap! This understandment serves as your eyes - and without it you are blind - 

For example I've met so many noobs that buy Doge Coin believing that "If BitCoin was once under a cent - and now its worth Thousands 

I don't see why Doge Coin can't do the same" You see these people are blind - they can't see the equation - the numbers - so they have no idea

how to calculate realistic expectations! They don't know how valuable each stonk/coin/token can get because they don't understand how the market works

much less a simple equation to calculate the market cap - if they knew how the math works they'd figure out real quick that there isn't

enough money in the world for Doge Coins to be worth the same as Bitcoins -



1 trillion vs 1 triollion example



Look theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - and market cap will give you an idea of how valuable a company is





and its potential for growth! 

it tells you how much 

Lets look at bitcoin for example - 

Lets look at Walmart - 

Bitcoin is more valuable than walmart -
