if a company fails its because they aren't providing/creating value
if someone creates value someone is going to want it etc etc. (for another video - incomplete quote i came up with to work on - also people
would make more money if they made things to help others rather than to make money - thats why businesses fails)

the biggest mistake people make is doubting themselves clip/quote i forgot what it said

Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap!  Thats how valuable Bitcoin is at the time of this recording!  Its actually bigger

than walmart and amazon at the time of this recording - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally owning piece of the company? - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - giving Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - because you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset/mentality are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head -  they don't even understand how valuable a market is to begin with! 

So they literally can't set realistic expectations! If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - because theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

In order for $DOGE to trade for $1000 per token - its market cap would need to reach about $140 Trillion Dollars - theres simply enough money in the

world to flow into $DOGE coin to raise its market cap to such extremes that its price blasts beyond $1,000 per token - 

Not even the U.S. National Debt is that big! - or is it?  Just kidding - but look even with $BITCOINS all time high market cap of $1.2 Trillion - 

that would only put $DOGE at $8.00 per token - so now lets be realistic why would anyone buy $DOGE for $1,000 when they can just scoop it up for a couple of 

cents from exchanges ? the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable as someone will 

immediately cash out - and change their lifes forever by dumping on the market! The only other way for $DOGE to hit $1,000 per token would be

via Hyper Inflation - but we're not gonna go there today - So what you should take out of all this is that the supply of stonks and tokens plays a 

key role/factor in determining an assets value - scarcity mingled with supply and demand will determines its value - for they're only worth as much 

as people are willing to pay for them - and their value times the supply circulating in the economy tells you how valuable a market is!

Hence the word Market Cap! Market Cap is most useful in figuring out how big a market, company, or crypto project is!  

You see theres a spectrum of market cap sizes - 

Starting with the largest we have 

HUMONGOUS HUGE MEGA LARGE CAPS = ANYTHING BEYOND $1 Trillion Market Cap can be considered HUUUUUUGE - HUMONGOUS

not many companies achieve this - but if you were to sum up the value of something like all the global real-estate market - or all the banks

in the world - thats when you start seeing these multi $trillion dollar evaluations - Black Rock, for example - is in the business

of selling stonks - thus they have a share in every company in the world - currently managing over $10 Trillion Dollars worth of Assets! 

$Apple and $Amazon are also in this HUMONGOUS cap category - because their market caps are beyond $1 Trillion - meaning

all their stonks combined are worth $Trillions at the moment - Bitcoin was once a $Trillion Dollar Asset too!  

And The Net Worth Evaluation for Billionaires, like Bezos - part of it actually comes from owning stonks in companies!  

and why would you want to own stonks?  Well according to TheReaBradLea - "the CEO of coca cola made 50 billion bucks last year - thats earned income - 

governments can take half of it - warren buffet invests in coca cola - he was payed 508 Million - thats passive income - you know how a lot of people 

in the internet want to be the boss? the boss doesn't make any money - the investor does - don't be the boss - don't be the ceo - be the investor -

because investors receive typically receive dividends for owning part of the company! which is the distribution of a company's earnings to its 

shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors . A dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. 

When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is 

taken to be re-invested in the business. 

Anyways after HUMONGOUS HUGE LARGE CAPS we simply have MEGA LARGE CAPS - which is anything sitting between $200 Billion to $1 Trillion 

A Great Example of this would be a company like WalMart Currently sitting at $X

Most mature companies you know and love - like the fortune 100s - sit in this category 

Next are the Large Caps - which is anything between $10-200 Billion

Then are the Mid Caps at 2-19 Billion

Small Caps at 300 Million - 2 Billion

MicroCap 50 Million - 300 Million

SUPER ULTRA DIAMOND MICROCAP SUPER GEM - > anything below 50 million

Alkimi + staking

returns are exponential
lower  = riskier
higher = stabler
higher risk = higher return  

There are 4 times


why buy stonks? dividends
growth = returns


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example - two tokens can have same price with different market caps 

and its potential for growth!
