if a company fails its because they aren't providing/creating value
if someone creates value someone is going to want it etc etc. (for another video - incomplete quote i came up with to work on - also people
would make more money if they made things to help others rather than to make money - thats why businesses fails)

the biggest mistake people make is doubting themselves clip/quote i forgot what it said

Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that gives you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap!  Thats how valuable Bitcoin is at the time of this recording!  Its actually bigger

than walmart and amazon at the time of this recording - Did you know that owning stonks in a company is literally owning piece of the company? - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - giving Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - because you won't know what you're doing!  You literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on your investment is concerned - 

so you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset/mentality are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head -  they don't even understand how valuable a market is to begin with! 

So they literally can't set realistic expectations! If they understood the concept of market cap - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - because theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

In order for $DOGE to trade for $1000 per token - its market cap would need to reach about $140 Trillion Dollars - theres simply enough money in the

world to flow into $DOGE coin to raise its market cap to such extremes that its price blasts beyond $1,000 per token - 

Not even the U.S. National Debt is that big! - or is it?  Just kidding - but look even with $BITCOINS all time high market cap of $1.2 Trillion - 

that would only put $DOGE at $8.00 per token - so now lets be realistic why would anyone buy $DOGE for $1,000 when they can just scoop it up for a couple of 

cents from exchanges ? the only way it could hit $1,000 is if someone pays $1,000 for it - but that won't be very sustainable as someone will 

immediately cash out - and change their lifes forever by dumping on the market! The only other way for $DOGE to hit $1,000 per token would be

via Hyper Inflation - but we're not gonna go there today - So what you should take out of all this is that the supply of stonks and tokens plays a 

key role/factor in determining an assets value - scarcity mingled with supply and demand will determines its value - for they're only worth as much 

as people are willing to pay for them - and their value times the supply circulating in the economy tells you how valuable a market is!

Hence the word Market Cap! Market Cap is most useful in figuring out how big a market, company, or crypto project is!  

You see theres a spectrum of market cap sizes - 

Starting with the largest we have 

HUMONGOUS HUGE MEGA LARGE CAPS = ANYTHING BEYOND $1 Trillion Market Cap can be considered HUUUUUUGE - HUMONGOUS

not many companies achieve this - but if you were to sum up the value of something like all the global real-estate market - or all the banks

in the world - thats when you start seeing these multi $trillion dollar evaluations - Black Rock, for example - is in the business

of selling stonks - thus they have a share in every company in the world - currently managing over $10 Trillion Dollars worth of Assets! 

$Apple and $Amazon are in this HUMONGOUS cap category - because their market caps are over $1 Trillion - meaning

all their stonks combined are worth $Trillions at the moment - The Net Worth Evaluation for Billionaires, like Bezos - part of it actually comes 

from owning stonks in companies! and why would you want to own stonks?  Well according to TheReaBradLea - "the CEO of coca cola made 50 billion bucks 

last year - thats earned income - governments can take half of it - warren buffet invests in coca cola - he was payed 508 Million - 

thats passive income - you know how a lot of people in the internet want to be the boss? the boss doesn't make any money - the investor does - 

don't be the boss - don't be the ceo - be the investor - because investors typically receive dividends quarterly for owning part of the company! 

dividends are a distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors . In other words -

its the distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the 

profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business. Bitcoin was once a $Trillion Dollar Asset but since

the crash its now fallen into the MEGA LARGE CAP category - which is anything between $200 Billion to $1 Trillion

Walmart is also in this Category - currently sitting at $382.16 Billion Dollars

The reason they're called MEGA LARGE CAPS is because anything in this category or bigger is simply already too big - if you're trying to make 

generational wealth to retire - you've already missed the train already if you're trying to get life changing gains with this company - 

I often see new investors with 0 knowledge about market cap throw money at mom and pops classic stonks like Walmart in hopes that it will

make them insane wealth to retire - then they get mad when their $10 dollar investment doesn't turn into $1,000 over night - and then

proceed to talk shit about investing to discourage others from do so too - If they only understood how market cap worked - they would figure out that

in order for their $10 investment in a Walmart to turn into $1,000 - $Walmart Stonks would need to 100X in price and market cap too!  And back to what

we were discussing earlier - theres only so much in the world!  And if walmart is already at $382 Billion, a 100 X would place it at $382 Trillion!

Which is probably more money than even exists!  So thats not going to be happening any time soon... 

A more realistic expectation for investing in Walmart would be for the Market Cap to Double!  That would place it at $764 Billion - that would turn

the $10 investment into $20!  woah money example here you know which one 





then be dissapointed because their $10 didn't turn into $1000 over night.  Well jesus christ mathematically the facts are that if a company like

Walmart which is already sitting at $400 billion, in order for you to turn your $10 into $1000 Walmart would need to grow to $X market cap

and thats simply not going to happen - so right off the back newbie investors will be dissapointed and then start telling everyone how shitty their

investing experience is and discourage others from doing the same 

Most mature companies you know and love from the fortune 100s - sit in this category 

Next are the Large Caps - typically ranging anywhere from $20-200 Billion. 

Then are the Mid Caps at 2-19 Billion

Small Caps at 300 Million - 2 Billion

MicroCaps between 50 Million - 300 Million

and SUPER ULTRA DIAMOND MICROCAP SUPER GEM - > anything below 50 million

Also I do want to say - that I made this chart up in case it wasn't obvious enough - however this is the rubric I use in my mind to determine

the size of companies before investing - and many experienced investors have a similar rubric in their mind to classify sizes of market caps

in their minds - 


Alkimi + staking

returns are exponential
lower  = riskier
higher = stabler
higher risk = higher return  

There are 4 times


why buy stonks? dividends
growth = returns


1 trillion vs 1 triollion example - two tokens can have same price with different market caps 

and its potential for growth! 

it tells you how much 

There are diferent sizez 

small caps more room to grow
explain how over complicate words in finance
how to use
dividends - stake
why important
how use
dividend stoake

small = more volitile
diviersify portfolio 

rich middle small
