Hello World -

If you're Invested in Stocks or Crypto - and you don't know what the word "Market Cap" Is - you're lost - you don't know what you're doing

If you want to SUCCEED - YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK - THAT MEANS YOU MUST EXPAND YOUR MIND TO NEW DIMENSIONS BY BROADENING YOUR VOCABULARY

So Add Market Cap to your ARSENAL OF WORDS - Because its an important tool to determine how much money you can actually make  - Hence -

Set realistic expectations - So What is Market Cap? Market Cap is short for Market Capitalization - a term commonly used in Stocks and Crypto 

and it literally just tells you how valuable a company is - and its determined by multiplying the total supply of shares or tokens 

times their current price and that will give you the market cap!  An evaluation for how valuable a market, company or project is!

For example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of X tokens - currently trading at $X each - so to calculate the market cap you would just multiply the X tokens 

times $ each and that gives you a total of $X as the market cap! which is just - If you didn't know - owning stonks is literally owning piece of a company - 

thats why they're called shares - because you own a share of the company - and to fully own a company - you have to own ALL the stonks - Remember when

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 Billion?  That evaluation came from buying ALL the stonks for $54.20 each - totalling to about $44 billion -

so basically ALL the Twitter share holders sold their stonks to Elon for $54.20 per share - granting Elon full ownership over the company -  

Look the Reason its important to understand how market cap works - is because it serves as your eyes - and without that undestandment you're

just blind - and you won't know what you're doing!  Because you literally won't know what to expect as far as your return on investment is concerned - 

and you won't be able to set realistic expectations - For example I've met so many beginner investors who'll buy Doge Coin with the idea that "If BitCoin was 

once under a cent - and its now worth thousands of dollars - why can't Doge Coin do the same thing" - But you see people with this mindset are blind - 

they literally can't see the equation and numbers in their head - so they literally can't calculate realistic expectations!  They don't know 

how valuable a stonk/token is - they can't even comprehend how valuable the company/project is to begin with! Because if they did - they would quickly realize that

$DOGE won't be trading for $ Thousands of Dollars any time soon - for there isn't enough money in the world to raise its market cap to such extremes that it

gives it such high value - look theres only so much money in the world - so markets can only get so big - 

Prices are based on supply and demand - however much people are willing to pay for it - and like cmon be realistic - no one will pay thousands

of dollars for Doge Coins when you can pick them up for $.08 - 

Market Caps are useful to find out how big a company is -
